# Pathology Reports

## Crossover - Software Engineer - PHP Assignment


 
## Considerations

I really liked this project, and I would like to dedicate more time to delivering my best performance, but unfortunately, I did not choose the time to start the project, because I had some problems with family commitments, my city.
I would like you to evaluate my codes even though you are not fully complete.
If I do not pass this test, I would still like the opportunity to repeat as soon as possible.
